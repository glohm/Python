#these relational operators allows us to compare elements by returning a Boolean value

v=4
a=5
c=5

#the "==", is used to check if a value is equal to another value
r1=c==v
r2=c==a

print (r1)
print (r2)

#the "!=" , is used to check if a value is differnt to another value

r3=c !=v
r4=c !=a

print (r3)
print (r4)

#mathematical relational oerators works in the same way for programming as they do on a Math problem: '<', '>', '<=','>='
r5=c<v
r6=c>a
r7=v<=a
r8=a>=c
print(r5)
