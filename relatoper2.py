#relational operators with strings:
v='Hello'
a='bye'
c='Hello'
x='die'
m='helloo'
r1=c==a
r2=c!=a
r3=c==v
r4=a==x
r5=m>=v

print (r1)
print (r2)
print (r3)
print (r4)

#the size of the 'm' string is bigger than the size of the 'v' string. The content had an extra valuable point to Python

print (r5)

#each letter had a different integer value on Python, according to it's position, as it does on ACSII coding for computer. So, some letters had more positional value on a numerical way than others.

b='Hola'
y='xwz'
g=y>=b
print (g)
